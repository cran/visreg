2.2-2
      * Fixed bug involvind an incompatibility between formulas with a . and
        formulas with an s() in them (2.2-1 extended visreg to formulas with
	a ., but this broke compatibility with formulas with s() and similar
	terms).

2.2-1
      * Changes to NAMESPACE for compatibility with development versions of R
      * Minor changes to make visreg compatible with 'quantreg' and 'betareg'
        packages
      * Improved support for packages that do not provide a residuals() generic
      * Deviance residuals now used for 'coxph' (survival) models instead
        of martingale residuals

2.2-0
      * Added support for random forests from the 'randomForest'
      	package
      * Added support for models from the 'rms' package.

2.1-1
      * Some bug fixes for contrast plots with lme4 models.
      * Fixed spline dependency in survival examples.
      * plot.visreg can now return trellis objects so that you can
      	arrange multiple trellis plots to your liking.

2.1-0
      * Major overhaul to visreg's internal structure.  visreg now
        returns simple, structured objects that a user can modify and
        inspect prior to plotting.
      * Related to that, visreg() now separated from plot.visreg()
      * Improved formula parsing so that it now works properly for
      	te() and ti() models (mgcv), pspline models (survival), more 
	complex formulas from lme4, and more (thank you to Andrew
	Vitale for giving me a good, complex model formula to test
	against).
      * Bug fixes with strip.names: now works for factors and shingles
      	for both overlay and lattice plots (thank you to Dan Silver
	for pointing this out).

2.0-6
      * Fixed issue with S4 models not being compatible with
      	as.formula().  visreg now refrains from calling as.formula.
	Thank you to Nick Livingston for bringing this issue to my
	attention.
      * Changed defaults so that rugs are plotted instead of partial
      	residuals when a transformation has been applied.

2.0-5
      * Fixed bug arising when passing plot options such as 'xlim'
      	when used in conjunction with lme4 models.  Thank you to
	Vincent Maire for pointing this bug out.

2.0-4
      * Added compatibility with models from the 'lme4' package
      	 (Thank you to Jack Hogg for pointing out this
	 incompatibility); same limitations regarding error bands as
	 'lme' models

2.0-3
      * Added compatibility with 'lme' models; conditional models
      	 still cannot include error bands due to lack of this feature
	 in predict.lme, but the package will produce reasonable plots
	 of means and partial residuals (Thank you to Jason Rohr for 
	 pointing out this incompatibility and the bugs below)
      * Fixed bug in passing 'scales' to latticePlot
      * Fixed bug when trying to panel by every unique value of 'by'
      	 variable
      * Added option to manually relabel panel strips

2.0-2
      *  Made compatible with output from the 'survey' package (Thank
      	  you to Marco Pomati for pointing this incompatibility out)
      *  Fixed calling of generics to be compatible with changes in
      	  R version 3.1.
      *  Fixed bug for mlm models in which users received an incorrect
      	  warning about residuals.
      *  Improved generalizability of fillFrame with factors; was
      	  incompatible with some instances of predict().

2.0-1
      *  Bug fix for spline models of variables with '.' in their names
      *  Bug fix for survival models in which the Surv object is
      	  created outside the call to visreg
      *  Fixed issue with levels of a factor being dropped from the
      	  model (Thank you to Johannes Kutsam for pointing this out)
      *  Scoping issue resolved; can now call visreg, visreg2d from a
      	  function without fit or data present in the global
	  environment (Thank you to Johannes Kutsam for pointing this
	  out)

2.0-0
      *  Added 'overlay' option
      *  Substantial internal refactoring to separate calculations /
      	  model manipulations from plotting
      *  Changed how 'breaks' are handled for continuous 'by'
      	  variables, both in setup and appearance, with option to
	  directly specify where breaks should occur
      *  Added print.cond option, with warning when user tries to plot
          a main effect in the presence of interactions
      *  Extrapolation now allowed
      *  Addition of 'rug' option
      *  Addition of 'band' option to suppress confidence bands

      *  Fixed bug in calculation of confidence bands for
      	  quasilikelihood models (thank you to Ariel Muldoon for
	  pointing this out)
      *  Fixed side-effect which caused trellis settings to be changed
      	  when visreg changed them internally

1.2-0
      *  Fixed bug in 'removeFormulaFormatting'; further compatibility
      	  for splines with use of 'cond'
      *  Added support for models from the 'gam' package
      *  Improved support for 'coxph' models from 'survival' package
      *  Fixed bug in use of ns/bs with type='effect'

1.1-1
      *  Fixed bug in 'removeFormulaFormatting'; old version was
      	  incompatible with use of ns() or bs() for splines

1.1-0
      *  Added support for multiple response (class 'mlm') models
      *  Fixed bug in 'ask' behavior when multiple plots created
      *  Allow finer control of plots with line.par, fill.par,

      *  Changed default for ylabels to las=1 (always horizontal) 
      	  (Thank you to Doug Bates for this advice)

1.0-0
      *  Submitted to CRAN
      *  Improved support for effect plots:
	  - extensive revision to implementation
      	  - 'x' can now be categorical
	  - interactions/conditioning allowed
      *  Improved support for visreg2d
          - Interface/options consistent with visreg 
	  - Internal refactoring to share code between visreg and
	    visreg2d
	  - Should work now with glm/rlm/gam/etc., although I haven't
	    tested all of these
      *  Fixed bug in 'ask' behavior when multple plots created
      *  Changed default (effect/conditional) for coxph models and
          fixed bug that occurred for coxph effect plots
      *  Default 'ylim' now depends on 'partial' argument
      *  Removed 'fill' option; always median fill from now on
      *  Patched get_all_vars bug when variables are in environment
          rather than data frame
      *  Added option to display panel strip names T/F
      *  Added some padding to xlim/ylim for lattice plots
      *  Default for 'ylab' changed: Delta added for effect plot
      *  Improved support for gam/locfit models

0.4-0
      *  Substantial refactoring of visreg:
      	  - new setupCond function to handle setting up of cond when
      	    'by' variables are present
	  - new functions visregPlot and visregLatticePlot to
            separate work done by the two types of plots ('by' present
            or absent)
	  - new function getXY for code that visregPlot and
            visregLatticePlot share
      *  Internal changes to handling of whitespace when 'x' is a
      	  factor
      *  Default for 'ylab' changed to always be name of response
          variable; virtually impossible in the presense of
          transformations, link functions, etc., to automatically
          choose an appropriate name
      *  Plotting options now pass to lattice correctly
      *  ylim for lattice plots fixed
      *  xtrans for lattice fixed
      *  Changed manner in which cross-sections are taken when 'by' is
          numeric; number of observations in each cross-section is now
          more even

0.3-0
      *  Reorganized frame construction again, using 'get_all_vars';
          now works with missing data and various other strange
          situations where f(x) is in the model but x isn't
      *  Added 'jitter' option
      *  Improved handling of trellis parameters

0.2-0
      *  Added by argument to support interactions (still buggy)
      *  visreg() now returns 'x' and 'y' invisibly
      *  Reorganized frame construction, using 'extract.frame' to
          reduce redundancy
      *  Modified default behavior of CI widths to make compatible with
          coxph models
      *  Resolved type/type2 conflict in visreg2d with 'plot.type'
      	  option
      *  Added 'scale' option for GLMs
      *  Added documentation (not finished)

0.1-0
      *  Added glm suport
      *  Added factor support in 1d version
      *  Added "terms" option for 2d plots
      *  Added 'cond' option for setting specific predictor variables
          for both versions (1d and 2d)
      *  The most common instance of each factor is chosen by default
          if the model includes factors
      *  Fixed bug for transformations for 2d plots
      *  Fixed bug that occurs when model is fit without supplying a
          data frame (i.e., when all variables are in the global
          environment)
      *  Fixed bug that occurs when a variable is class 'logical'
      *  Added 'partial' and 'xtrans' options

0.0-3
      *  Added 'trans' option for transforming response variable,
          axes still need changing when option is used, the centerFrame
          function is causing a problem when a transformed variable is
          used in the model
      *  Changed internal data frame evaluation, allowing the ability
          to lookup variables in the original data frame when
          constructing derived variables
          NOTE: Doing so rendered fillX obsolete and resulted in
                substantial changes to fillFrame, centerFrame, and
                setupD
          NOTE: This issue still causes an error if the variable is
                located in the global environment instead of the data
                frame; I see no easy way to resolve this error.

0.0-2
      *  Added fill='median' option

0.0-1 
      *  Added 'type' option to visreg, allowing both conditional and
          term plots
      *  Changed default y label in visreg
      *  Added fill='zero' option

0.0-0 
      *  Package infrastructure established
      *   visreg.R, visreg2d.R: Polynomial terms handled correctly
