# Visualization of Regression Models

`visreg` provides a number of plotting functions for visualizing fitted regression models: regression functions, confidence bands, partial residuals, interactions, and more.  For details on `visreg` syntax and how to use it, please consult the `R` help files.  For details on what `visreg` does and how it works, refer to the following paper:

> [Breheny P and Burchett W. (2013).  Visualizing regression models using visreg.](http://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/publications/visreg.pdf)
